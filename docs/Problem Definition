Right now, most contractors and small crews keep track of their working hours in ways that are messy and unreliable. 
Some write them down on paper, others type them into spreadsheets, and a lot of people just text their hours to the boss. 
This usually causes problems.Workers sometimes forget to clock in or out, hours get miscalculated,
and supervisors spend too much time checking and fixing everyone’s timesheets.
Business owners also don’t always know who is on site or how long they’ve been there.

Because of this, hours can get lost, paychecks might not be correct, and preparing reports for payroll or billing takes way longer than it should.

The problem is that there isn’t a simple, easy-to-use app made for contractors that lets workers clock in and out quickly, 
even when offline, and then puts all of that information into a clean report without the usual mistakes.
