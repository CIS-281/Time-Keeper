5. Timeline
Week 1 -2 : (Analysis) Finish Gathering Client information, & identify Project Requirements, Reasearch existing commercial software packages & determine whather it is better for your client to buy and exisiting product or to contract our group to build one.
Week 3 -4 : (Analysis) Create Traditional Models that define the solution to the business problem. Event Table, ER Diagrams, DFDs & pseudocode for the DFD processes. (Design Desicions are still logical as opposed to physical. For ex, your group might know that you will need a database, but you will not yet have made the final decision on which commercial database to use.
Create UML Diagrams that are common in the IT industry, Use-case Diagrams, Domain class Diagram, System Sequence Diagram, Activity Diagram, Statechart Diagram
Week 5 - 6 : (Design) Logical models are updated with physical design decisions. Ex. The orginal Domain class Diagram will be updated to contain classes methods, attributes, and data types. Discuss UI design, and address security and networking considerations
Create the prototype, test the prototype with vital use cases to make sure system solves the business problem
Week 6 - 7 : (Implementation) Revise Protoype, Create a Test Plan, Create the Instalation Plan, Deliver Documentation, Identify Post-Installation Plan for Maintenance, Identify Support Plan
Create a Training Plan
Week 7 - 8 : (Testing ) Revise prototype based on feedback learned during testing, submit a document of logs (Project Testing Log File or Summary Assignment)
(Presentation) Prepare and deliver Final Project Presentation
