Branch Overview

We have to make sure we select our working branch when coding in android studio. (front, back, design, ...) never code in main branch!
Main branch only gets done, working code over pull requests once your code is working and pushed to your work branch into github.

This are some (all for now) of the working branches:
(Working branches are like your work stations where you experiment how the new code interacts and works with the existing one)

feat/backend - SQLite database setup
GPS auto clock-in/out
Payroll export + deployment
QA testing

feat/frontend - UI screens
Task CRUD interface
Calendar view
Navigation

feat/design - Mockups, wireframes
UI styling
Icons, branding

main - only ready to use, working, bug free code is megred here via pull requests within github. This will be our stable and deployable program.
